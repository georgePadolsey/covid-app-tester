# John's Covid Scanner

![Logo](public/icon-192x192.png)

This is a simple app just used to validate any QR codes given by the Durham University LFT scheme. It keeps a list of all people’s details scanned through it (valid or invalid) locally on the phone (no scanned information is transmitted). You can access these by clicking the “People Scanned” button. In this you can export (as an excel file) or clear the people scanned.

You can use it directly from the webpage or install it as an app.

The App can be found at (it requires camera access): [https://stjohnscommonroom.org.uk/covid-test/](https://stjohnscommonroom.org.uk/covid-test/)
